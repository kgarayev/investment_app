## :page_facing_up: Overview

The Investment App is a web application that allows users to manage their investments and trade shares. It was created back in 2020 as my first foray into web development. The app was built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (jQuery) for the front end, while Python Flask and SQLite were used for the back end. This project provided me with a solid foundation in web development and an understanding of web protocols.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Features

The Investment App offers the following key features:

- User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and securely log in to access their investment portfolio.
- Share Viewing: Users can browse and view detailed information about different shares available for investment.
- Share Lookup: The app provides a search function to easily find specific shares based on user-defined criteria.
- Share Cart: Users can add selected shares to their cart for convenient management and future reference.
- Share Trading: Users can buy and sell shares using the funds available in their investment accounts.

On the backend, the app utilises databases and hashing techniques for secure user registration and login. It also communicates with an API to retrieve real-time data about shares. Python Flask framework is used to create routes, and Jinja is employed for HTML template rendering. The app also utilises cookies to store selected items in the cart.

## :art: Styling

The Investment App features a clean and user-friendly interface. The CSS was developed using Bootstrap. 

## :rocket: Opportunities for Improvement

While the Investment App is functional and user-friendly, there are several areas that could be enhanced:

- Third-Party Registration and Login: Implementing options for users to register and log in using their Google, Facebook, or other third-party accounts.
- Payment Integration: Integrating a secure payment system to facilitate seamless share trading transactions.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Optimising the app's design and layout for a better user experience on mobile devices.
- Error Handling: Implementing improved error handling mechanisms to provide users with clear and informative error messages.
